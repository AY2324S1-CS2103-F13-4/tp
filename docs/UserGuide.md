UniMate is a desktop app for students to **manage contacts** and **manage schedules** optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, UniMate can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `UniMate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for UniMate.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar UniMate.jar` command to run the application.<br><br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app contains some sample data,
which may differ from that of a fresh download.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br><br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

# Features Overview

UniMate has 3 core features, [**Address Book**](#main-feature-1-address-book), [**Calendar System**](#main-feature-2-calendar-system)
and [**Task Management System**](#main-feature-3-task-management-system). This section serves to
provide you with an overview of what each component entails and the functionalities supporting them.

![uniMateFeatureOverview](images/uniMateFeatures.png)

The screenshot above shows a cropped view of UniMate's GUI. **ADDRESS BOOK** belongs to the [**Address Book** feature](#main-feature-1-address-book),
**CALENDAR** belongs to the [**Calendar System** feature](#main-feature-2-calendar-system) and the **EVENT LIST/TASK LIST**
portion is shared by both the [**Calendar System** feature](#main-feature-2-calendar-system) and [**Task Management System** feature](#main-feature-3-task-management-system).

>To switch between the [Event List](#sub-feature-2-event-list) and [Task List](#main-feature-3-task-management-system),
we have a [CLI-based command](#viewing-tasks-switchlist) for that.

## Main feature 1: Address Book

The address book serves to ease contact management. 

Some major CLI-based functionalities to support this feature include:
- [**Adding**](#adding-a-person-add), [**deleting**](#deleting-a-person--delete) and [**editing**](#editing-a-person--edit) operations to manipulate contacts in the address book
- [**Finding**](#locating-persons-by-name-find) and [**filtering**](#filtering-persons-by-attribute-filter) operations to search for and isolate contacts of interest
- [**Sorting**](#sort-persons--sort) operation to reorganise the view of the address book when needed 

Other functionalities can be found in the [Address Book Management subsection found in the Features section](#address-book-management).

Additionally, each contact in the address book has their own personal calendar, 
which can be accessed simply by double-clicking with the left mouse button on the contact's card in the address book.
This will create a pop-up displaying the contact's calendar as shown below. 

![contactCalendar](images/contactCalendar.png)

**Note:** There is currently no CLI-based command to access this feature, but is planned for a future release.

## Main feature 2: Calendar System
The calendar system seeks to improve the user's schedule planning experience, as well as simplify
the synchronization of schedules among multiple people. 

To achieve this, we have 2 supporting sub-features:
1. [Calendar](#sub-feature-1-calendar)
2. [Event List](#sub-feature-2-event-list)

For the calendar system, we work solely with `events`, which differs from `tasks` used in the [task list feature](#main-feature-3-task-management-system).
: `event` has a `description`, `start date and time` and `end date and time`
: `task` only has a `description` and `end date and time`

### Sub-feature 1: Calendar

The calendar allow the user to plan their timetable and compare it against their contacts' schedules. 
This will hopefully facilitate scheduling of meetings and events involving the user and their contacts.

>By default, the calendar's GUI will only display the time period of <mark>8am to 6pm</mark>, but will automatically
extend when events that cannot be fit within this time period are added.
> 
>Additionally, the GUI for this sub-feature currently only supports viewing of events <mark>within the current week</mark>.
Upcoming updates will allow the user to navigate beyond this chronological restriction. In the meantime, users can
consider using the [Event List](#sub-feature-2-event-list) to view events outside the current week.

For the **user**'s calendar, some major CLI-based functionalities supporting this sub-feature includes:
- [Adding](#adding-an-event-addevent), [deleting](#deleting-an-event-deleteevent) and [clearing](#deleting-multiple-events-clearevents) operations to manipulate the events in the user's calendar

For the **contact**'s calendar, some major CLI-based functionalities supporting this sub-feature includes:
- [Adding](#adding-an-event-to-a-contact), [deleting](#deleting-an-event-from-a-contact) and [editing](#edit-contact-calendar-event) operations to manipulate the events in the contact's calendar

Other useful CLI-based functionalities not exclusive to the user/contact supporting this sub-feature includes:
- Comparison operations to compare the user's calendar with their contacts' calendars either by [index](#1-comparison-by-index) or [tag](#2-comparison-by-tag)

Other functionalities can be found in the [Calendar System subsection of the Features section](#calendar-system)

### Sub-feature 2: Event List

The event list displays all the events for the user/contact. It serves as an overview of the collective
events that the user or their contact have.

The event list shown on the main UniMate GUI is the user's event list. To view a specific contact's
event list, we have a [CLI-based command](#viewing-another-persons-events-viewcontactevents) that will
display the contact's event list in a popup window.

## Main-feature 3: Task Management System

The task list stores a collection of tasks that the user might have. The primary difference
between event and task is that a task does not have a starting date and time.

Some useful CLI-based functionalities supporting this feature includes:
- [Adding](#adding-tasks-addtask) and [deleting](#deleting-tasks-deletetask) operations to manipulate the tasks present in the task list
- [Sorting](#sorting-tasks-sorttask) operation to reorganise the view of the task list when needed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

## General Features
### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

**Tip:** A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

![addCommand](images/addCommand.png)

In the example, after executing
`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`, we see `John Doe`'s
contact information stored in the address book as the 7th contact on the left-hand side of the GUI.

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book. This command is particularly useful to
display all the contacts after using the `find` and `filter` commands.

Format: `list`

![listCommand](images/listCommand.png)

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided
* Existing values will be updated to the input values
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

![editCommand](images/editCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `edit 1 p/12345678`, `Alex Yeoh` the person with index 1 has his
phone number edited to `12345678`.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search)
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

* Filter is case-insensitive. e.g. `cs2103` will match `CS2103`
* The order of the fields does not matter
* All provided fields are searched
* All tags containing the words will be matched e.g. `Ba` will return `Badminton` or `Basketball` or `Football` or `Backgammon`
* Only persons matching all specified fields will be returned (i.e. `and` search)

Examples:
* `filter t/CS2103` - Displays all contacts with the CS2103 tag or tags containing ``CS2103`` e.g. CS2103T
* `filter t/MA2116 t/CS1010S n/John e/@u.nus.edu` - Displays all contacts with the ``MA2116`` and ``CS1010S`` tags as well as
with a name containing ``John`` and an email address with the domain ``u.nus.edu``

![filterCommand](images/filterCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `filter t/colleagues`, the address book list displays all contacts
that have the `TAG` colleague.

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

![deleteCommand](images/deleteCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `list`, followed by `delete 7`, `John Doe`, the person with index 7 
is removed from the displayed address book

### Sort persons : `sort`

Format: `sort /COMPARATOR`

* Sorts all persons by specified `COMPARATOR`
* Currently supported `COMPARATOR` include:
    - `byname`
    - `byemail`
    - `byphone`
    - `byaddress`
* The comparator refers to the attribute(s) provided for the basis to sort
* The sorting is done according to ASCII value
* Sorting is done in ascending order by default. To sort by descending order, the keyword `reverse` can be used (see Examples below)

Examples:
* `sort /byname` sorts all contacts in UniMate address book by the full name of `Person`
* `sort /byaddress /reverse` sorts all contacts in UniMate address book by the address of `Person`

![sortCommand](images/sortCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `sort /byphone`, the address book is now sorted according to the
contact's phone numbers, in ascending numerical order.


### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

## Calendar System

### Deleting an event: `deleteEvent`

Deletes an event from the user's calendar.

Format `deleteEvent DATE_TIME_DURING_EVENT`

* Deletes an event at the specified date and time.
* An event is considered to be at that date and time if the date time lies between the start time (inclusive) and the
end time (exclusive).
* If there is no event during `DATE_TIME_DURING_EVENT`, an error will be thrown.

Example:
`deleteEvent 2023-11-01 12:00`

### Deleting multiple events: `clearEvents`

Clears all events within a specified time range.

Format: `clearEvents ts/START_DATE_TIME te/END_DATE_TIME c/CONFIRMATION`

* An event is considered to be within the time range if overlaps with the time range for any period of time.
* When the `CONFIRMATION` is absent, the command shows all events within the time range but does not delete them. The
same command is then shown with the confirmation included that can be copied and pasted to execute the command.
* If there is no `START_DATE_TIME` or `END_DATE_TIME`, an error will be thrown.

### Viewing all events

Events can be viewed from the calendar that appears on the right.

Additionally, a list of all events are displayed by default at the bottom. This list at the bottom can be switched to a
task list with the `switchList` command. More information can be found under `Viewing all Tasks`.

### Adding an event to a contact

Format `deleteContactEvent INDEX ts/DATE_TIME`

* Deletes an event that contains the `DATE_TIME` from the contact

Example:
* `deleteContactEvent 1 ts/2024-01-01 09:00`



### Comparing calendars with AddressBook Contacts

There are two ways for the user to compare calendars with their AddressBook Contacts. 
Namely, the user can either isolate contacts of interest with their respective index,
or compare calendars with a group of contacts using their tags. Therefore, the user can
consider the following two commands and choose whichever suits their needs more.

The resulting pop-up calendar will pop up with the time periods where all parties
are not available greyed out. The pop-up has to be closed in order for the user to access
the main application again.

Note that the arguments for the commands are optional, hence `compareCalendars` and
`compareGroupCalendars` are valid commands, but the resulting pop-up will just display the
user's calendar.

#### 1. Comparison by index

Format `compareCalendars [INDEX]...`

* Compare calendar with the contacts at the respective `INDEX`
* `INDEX` must be a positive non-zero integer that is smaller than the size of the AddressBook
* If the `INDEX` number provided is invalid, an error will be returned
* If no `INDEX` is supplied, the resulting pop-up will just display the user's calendar

Example:
`compareCalendars 1 3 5`

#### 2. Comparison by tag

Format `compareGroupCalendars [TAG]...`

* Compare calendar with the contacts with the specified `TAG`
* If some of the `TAG` provided are invalid, the resulting pop-up will ignore the invalid `TAG`
* If all the `TAG` provided are invalid, the resulting pop-up will just display the user's calendar
* If no `TAG` is supplied, the resulting pop-up will just display the user's calendar

Example:
`compareGroupCalendars school friends`

### Import *.ics files (Coming Soon)

User can import *.ics files, which will automatically be integrated into
their UniMate calendars.

Format: `import FILE_PATH`

### View other weeks of Calendar (Coming Soon)

User can view other weeks of their calendar schedule beyond just the
current week.

Format: `viewWeek DATE`

### Deleting multiple events: `clearEvents`

Clears all events within a specified time range.

Format: `clearEvents ts/START_DATE_TIME te/END_DATE_TIME c/CONFIRMATION`

* Deletes all events from the specified start date and time to the specified end date and time.
* An event is considered to be within the time range if overlaps with the time range for any period of time.
* When the `CONFIRMATION` is absent, the command shows all events within the time range but does not delete them. The
same command is then shown with the confirmation included that can be copied and pasted to execute the command.
* If there is no `START_DATE_TIME` or `END_DATE_TIME`, an error will be thrown.


### Viewing all events

Events in the current week can be viewed from the calendar that appears on the right.

Additionally, a list of all events are displayed by default at the bottom. This list at the bottom can be switched to a
task list with the `switchList` command. More information can be found under `Viewing all Tasks`.

### Adding an event to a contact

Adds an event to a contact's calendar at the specified index.

Format: `addContactEvent INDEX d/DESCRIPTION ts/START_DATE_TIME ts/END_DATE_TIME`

* Adds the event starting from `START_DATE_TIME` and ending at `END_DATE_TIME`
* `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` must be in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format

Example:
* `addContactEvent 1 d/Team Meeting ts/2024-01-01 09:00 te/2024-01-01 11:00`

### Deleting an event from a contact

Deletes an event from a contact's calendar at the specified index.

Format `deleteContactEvent INDEX ts/DATE_TIME`

* Deletes an event that contains the `DATE_TIME` from the contact

Example:
* `deleteContactEvent 1 ts/2024-01-01 09:00`

### Viewing another person's events: `viewContactEvents`

Creates a pop-up that displays a list of all events of a calendar belonging to a person in the Addressbook.

Format: `viewContactEvents INDEX`

* Views the event list of the person at `INDEX` as displayed.

## Task Management System

Tasks consist of a `DESCRIPTION` and a `DEADLINE`. 

### Viewing tasks: `switchList`

Switches the bottom list between the event list and the task list.

Format: `switchList`

* All input after `switchList` will be ignored.
* The bottom list displays the event list by default.

### Adding tasks: `addTask`

Adds a task to the Task Manager.

Format: `addTask d/DESCRIPTION [te/DEADLINE]`

* `DESCRIPTION` cannot be empty.
* `DEADLINE` must be in the same format given above for date and time.
* `DEADLINE` can also be omitted to create a task with no specified deadline

Examples: 
* `addTask d/Go for a run te/2023-02-14 19:00`
* `addTask d/Hydrate regularly!`

### Deleting tasks: `deleteTask`

Deletes a task from the Task Manager according to the index of the task displayed in the task list.

Format: `deleteTask INDEX`
        
* Throws an error if there is no `INDEX` present or if it exceeds the length of the task list.

### Sorting tasks: `sortTask`

Example: `editContactEvent 1 1 d/Nap`, `editContactEvent 2 3 ts/2023-10-10 10:00 te/2023-10-12 15:00`

* Note that all edited fields are optional, but there must be at least 1 edited field.

### Force saving all contacts and events

Forces a save of all current contacts and events in the program.

Format: `save`

* All data is also saved in the hard disk automatically when the program is closed.

### Saving the data

All data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Calendar data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/calendar.json`.
Task-list data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/taskmanager.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data files.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous UniMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
