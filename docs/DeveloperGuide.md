## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding Events

#### Implementation

The addEvent feature is facilitated by the `Calendar` class. It allows the users to block out some time
in their personal `Calendar` with some `Event` that has the following attributes:

* `DESCRIPTION`  —  Brief description of the `Event`
* `START_DATE_TIME`  —  Starting date and time of the `Event`
* `END_DATE_TIME`  —  End date and time of the `Event`

The syntax used to call this command is as follows: `addEvent d/DESCRIPTION ts/START_DATE_TIME te/END_DATE_TIME`,
with the `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` in the `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format. If any of the fields are missing
or if the formatting is incorrect, an error message will be thrown along with usage instructions on the correct
formatting.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addEvent feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The user's personal `Calendar` will be initialized
as an empty calendar.

Step 2. The user executes `addEvent d/Go to school ts/2023-10-26 08:00 te/2023-10-26 16:00` to add the `Event`
of `Go to school` from `2023-10-26 8am` to `2023-10-26 4pm`. This will call the `UniMateParser#execute()`,
passing in the user input from the user.

Step 3. Since the command is an `addEvent` command, it passes the user input to `AddEventCommandParser#parse()`
for parsing.

Step 4. The `AddEventCommandParser#parse` command will parse the command into 3 argument fields  — 
`DESCRIPTION`, `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME`. The `DESCRIPTION` is passed into
`ParserUtil#parseEventDescription()` to produce a `EventDescription` object, while the `START_DATE_TIME`
and `END_DATE_TIME` are passed into `ParserUtil#parseEventPeriod()` to produce a `EventPeriod` object.

**Note**: If the `DESCRIPTION` is empty, or the `START_DATE_TIME` or `END_DATE_TIME` are of invalid
format, a `ParseException` will be thrown, displaying the appropriate command usage format.

Step 5. The `EventDescription` and `EventPeriod` objects produced in Step 4 are then passed into
the constructor for `Event`, creating an `Event` object with the respective user-defined attributes. This
`Event` object is then passed into the constructor of the `AddEventCommand` object.

Step 6. `AddEventCommand#execute()` is then called, and the calendar will check if there is an existing
`Event` that has a conflicting timing with the new `Event` to be added. Since the calendar is empty,
no errors will be raised and the user will see his new `Event` displayed in the UI in the `My Calendar`
region.

**Note**: Suppose there is a conflicting `Event` that already exists in the `Calendar`
with the `Event` to be added, the new `Event` will not be added, and a message that states that there
is a timing conflict will be reflected in the UI status bar.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Appropriate time period of an event:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice): No restriction on time period**
    * Pros: Allows users to add multi-day `Event` such as multi-day business trips.
    * Cons: For users that rarely have multi-day `Event`, having to type the date twice when calling the command might be troublesome.
* **Alternative 2: Restrict events to a single day**
    * Pros: User only has to type date once when calling command.
    * Cons: For multi-day `Event`, user has to call the command multiple times for all the relevant days

{more aspects and alternatives to be added}

### Deleting Events

#### Implementation

The deletion of events is facilitated by the `model::deleteEventAt` method and the `model::findEventAt` method. The
former method deletes the event stored in the `Calendar` object which itself is an attribute of the `Model` object by
calling a similar method `Calendar::deleteEventAt`. These methods take in a `LocalDateTime` object and finds the method
within the `Calendar` object, then in the case of `model::deleteEventAt`, deletes the event. Given below is an example
usage scenario of the command.

Step 1. The user launches the application and creates an event.

Step 2. The user executes `deleteEvent 2023-12-09 12:00` command to delete the event at that time. The `deleteEvent`
command calls `Model#findEventAt(LocalDateTime)` to find an event at the specified date and time. This event is then stored as a
variable `toDelete`.

**Note**: If no event is found at the specified date and time at any point of the command execution, an
`EventNotFoundException` is thrown which causes an error message to be displayed.

Step 3. The command then calls `Model#deleteEventAt(LocalDateTime)`. This method calls similar methods of
`Calendar#deleteEventAt(LocalDateTime)` which calls `AllDaysEventListManager#deleteEventAt(LocalDateTime)`.

Step 4. The `AllDaysEventListManager` checks for an event at the specified date and time again, then checks for all days
for which the event lasts for. Then, for each day, the event is removed from the `SingleDayEventList`.

Step 5. The deleted event which was previously stored in as a variable is displayed in the `CommandResult` to show the
user which command was deleted.

**Design considerations**

* The design of the `deleteEvent` command is dependent on the structure of the `Calendar` object. Should the structure
  of how the event objects are stored change, a new implementation will be required for the command.

### Contact Filtering

#### Implementation

The filtering function executed by `FilterCommand` is facilitated by the `PersonFilter` class.
which itself is similar to the `EditPersonDescriptor` class found in `EditCommand.java`. It stores the fields by which
the contacts are to be filtered and creates a predicate to facilitate the filtering. Notably, it implements the
following operation:

* `PersonFilter#matchesFilter(Person)` - Compares the values of the attributes of the `Person` to the strings stored as
  attributes in the `PersonFilter` object. This method is later used as a lambda method to filter the contact list.

Given below is an example of how the filter function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `filter n/Bob t/CS` to filter contacts to see only people with "Bob" in their name and have at
least 1 tag with "CS" in it. The input is passed to `UniMateParser` which then parses it with the `FilterCommandParser`.

Step 2. The `FilterCommandParser` parses the input and creates a corresponding `PersonFilter` object with null for all
parameters. It then sets all specified attributes of the created `PersonFilter` while leaving unspecified fields as
null. The `FilterCommandParser` finally returns a newly created `FilterCommand` with the PersonFilter used in the
constructor.

Step 3. `FilterCommand#execute` is called. In this method, `model#updateFilteredPersonList` is called with
`PersonFilter#matchesFilter` being used as the predicate. This updates the GUI and populates the filtered list with
only `Person` objects that match the filter.

Step 4. The number of people displayed is returned as a `CommandResult`.

### Contact Sorting

#### Implementation
The sort function executed by `SortCommand`.

The sort function allows users to sort all persons in `UniMate` based on a given criteria. The following criterion for sort are shown below
- Sort by name (optional: in the reverse order)
- Sort by address (optional: in the reverse order)
- Sort by email (optional: in the reverse order)
- Sort by phone (optional: in the reverse order)

The syntax used to call this command is as follows, without the [ ] braces: `sort [/byname][/byaddress][/byemail][byphone] [/reverse]`. Do note that sorting by reverse is optional.

Given below is an example of how the sort function works at each step. We will simulate a user using the sort function to sort UniMate contacts by name in descending order.
1. The user executes `sort /byname /reverse` to find his friend's contact. The input is passed into `UniMateParser` which then parses it with the `SortCommandParser`.
2. The `SortCommandParser` parses the input and first checks for arguments provided. If the arguments are empty, invalid or in the wrong format, a helper message will appear to allow the user to reference the sample run case. The arguments are then matched by the keywords provided to determine the basis for sorting using a `SortComparator`. All the comparators are added into an ArrayList of `SortComparator` for `SortCommand` to parse.
3. `SortCommand` is initialized parses the array from step 2 to determine the basis of comparison when the command is executed. The `SortCommandParser` finally returns a newly created `SortCommand` consisting of a Person Comparator that decides the method of sorting for the UniMate address book.
4. `SortCommand#execute` is called. In this method, `model#sortPersonList` is called with the Person Comparator created in step 3. This in turn calls `AddressBook#sortPersons` which calls the storage function to save the contacts in the json file based on the sorted order.
5. The GUI then reads in the json file to obtain the order of addresses and populates the sorted list with the sorting criteria provided.
6. The success message is returned as a `CommandResult` and displayed on the GUI result display panel.

**Design considerations**

* The design of the `sort` command is dependent on the structure of the `AddressBookStorage` object. Should the structure
  of how the AddressBook objects are stored change, a new implementation will be required for the command.

### TaskList Feature (Work in Progress)

#### Implementation

The proposed tasklist feature is facilitated by 'TaskList'. It extends a ReadOnlyTaskList that will be used for the
saving of the users' tasks. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

*`TaskList#addTask()` -- Adds a task to the current tasklist and saves it to memory.
*`TaskList#deleteTask()` -- Delete an existing task from the current tasklist and saves it to memory.
*`TaskList#editTask()` -- Edits an existing task from the current tasklist and saves it to memory.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTask()`, `Model#deleteTask()` and `Model#editTask()`
respectively.

##### Adding Task

The adding of tasks is facilitated by the `model#addTask()` method. 
The method adds a task to the `TaskList` object which itself is an attribute of the `ModelManager` object by
calling a similar method `Model::addTask()`. 
These methods take in a `Description` and `Optional(Deadline)` object and finds the method within the `TaskList` object,
then adds the `Task` object to the TaskList.
Given below is an example usage scenario of the command.

Step 1. The user launches the application and creates a task.

Step 2. The user executes `addTask d/CS2105 Assignment te/2023-12-12 12:00 ` command to add the task.
The `addTask` method in the model is called, adding the task to the tasklist, and saving the tasklist to memory.

**Note**: There is no limit to the number of tasks of the same description or deadline that can be created.

**Design considerations**

* The design of the `addTask` command is such that a deadline is made optional.
* This current implementation allows for more freedom to the user but might be more difficult to manage with the addition of Optionals.

##### Delete Task (To be added)

##### Edit Task (To be added)


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

4. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
5. Calendar should be able to check if there are any event timing conflicts within 1 second
6. System should be easily picked up by a freshman at NUS with just the application's website
